I had the following when attempting to import 'level' in bool.agda:

```
.../verified_fp_agda/01/bool.agda:3,13-18
The file /usr/local/Cellar/agda/2.5.4.2/lib/agda/src/Level.agda can
be accessed via several project roots. Both Level and level point
to this file.
When scope checking the declaration
  open import level
```

My temporary fix for this is to create 'level' locally and rename to 'level_'.
Then, open import 'level_'

I solved it by doing the following:

1. clone https://github.com/williamdemeo/ial
2. Per the README.md 
   + cd to ~/.agda, and add a file called "libraries" to it (if it doesn't already exist), containing the full path to the .agda-lib file 
contained in this directory (for the IAL version 1.3).
   + Then create a file called "defaults", and add the word "IAL" to it (no quotes). 
   + These steps tell Agda where the IAL library is, and that you want to include it when opening .agda files in emacs (or with the command-line tool).
3. Note 1 & 2 allow me to work in ial/1.3, but to work in this repository, I needed to clone
bool.agda and level.agda from ial/1.3 and rename them to bool1.agda and level1.agda to avoid name conflicts.
