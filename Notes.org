* TODO Fix problem importing 'level'

I had the following when attempting to import 'level' in bool.agda:

```
.../verified_fp_agda/01/bool.agda:3,13-18
The file /usr/local/Cellar/agda/2.5.4.2/lib/agda/src/Level.agda can
be accessed via several project roots. Both Level and level point
to this file.
When scope checking the declaration
  open import level
```

My temporary fix for this is to create 'level' locally and rename to 'level_'.
Then, open import 'level_'
